# Art_Gallery

This website is inspired by a frontend mentor challenge. I specifically liked the layout and style of the challenge and only by looking at the example I attempted to recreate the site.
In addition to frontend mentor layout. I added a mobile navigation bar, custom favicon, animate on scroll and some of my images differ from the original layout's images.
